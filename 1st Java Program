********************************
Creating Your first Java program
********************************



* Filename should be what the class name is. 
   - Class Name is Helloworld
  
  ***
  public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    } // end of main funtion scope 
  } //end of class HelloWorld scope
  ***


* Every Java program should have this line to be able to run:
      public static void main(String[] args) {
      

public - meaning that the method can be called from anywhere and from outside the program as well. 
static - meaning it exists and can be run by itself(at the class level without creating an object)
void - meaning it returns no value. 



Object oriented paradigm with a football team with one member. 

//define the team class. 
public class Team {
  Member member;
  public Team(Member member) { //who is in the team?
      this.member = member; // one 'member' is in this team 
  } // end of funtion Team scope
  
  //main method
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Member myMember = new Member("Auriel", "light", 10, 1);
    Team myTeam = new Team(myMember);
    System.out.println(myTeam.member.getName());
    System.out.println(myTeam.member.getType());
    System.out.println(myTeam.member.getLevel());
    System.out.println(myTeam.member.getRank());
  }

} //end of class Team scope


//define the Member Class
class Member {
  private String name;
  private String type;
  private int level; //int data type
  private int rank;
  
  public Member(String name, String type, int level, int rank) {
      this.name = name;
      this.type = type;
      this.level = level;
      this.rank = rank;
  }
  
  //define the getter functions
  public String getName() {
      return this.name; 
  }
    public String getType() {
      return this.name; 
  }
    public String getLevel() {
      return this.name; 
  }
    public String getRank() {
      return this.name; 
  }
}
